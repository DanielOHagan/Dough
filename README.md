# Dough

A Game engine written in C\+\+ using Vulkan.
Please note: I started this project so I could learn Vulkan, therefore, the code is not recommended for production use and is subject to change.
A small number of features from C\+\+17 are used so that version will be required to compile the project as is, however, only small parts rely on these features so changing to C\+\+14 could be done easily.
